# Javis_REACT_Portfolio 📒 📕 📗

## Description 📋

This is a portfolio that I have designed using REACT. On this application, you will see my latest work that I have developed and deployed. There is a section that tells you a little information about me as well as a gallery section for you to view my gallery and either visit the deployed site or visit the GitHub repository. Networking is very important in this industry, so I have also attached a resume to my portfolio along with a contact area with my contact information alongside my GitHub and Linkedin links attached. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I hope that you see something that inspired you. Stay Tuned!
